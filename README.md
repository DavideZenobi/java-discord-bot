P.D: This is a personal project and it's the first discord bot I have developed. There are many concepts of Pokémon battles that are disabled either due to the difficulty of managing them or due to the lack of information from the API. Of a total of 919 movements, there are 607 available and 312 prohibited
<br>
Examples:
- Items
- Weather effects
- Movements that influence previous or subsequent turns (e.g. focus energy)
- More...
